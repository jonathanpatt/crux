A base WordPress theme that acts as a well-structured starting point for
developing your own child theme.

## About

Crux is a WordPress base theme built to allow separation of markup and logic in your
child theme files. It's still fairly early in its development, and there are
a lot of interesting new ideas to be added to it, but feel free to give it
a spin and see how you like it.
