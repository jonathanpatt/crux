# crux

A WordPress base theme done right.

## About

Crux is a WordPress base theme built to allow separation of markup and logic in your
child theme files. **At this point it's in extremely early development and is
*absolutely* not in a state for use in a project.**

## Contributing

At this point, any contribution attempts will probably be rejected just because
I want to establish certain standards and behavior at this extremely early
stage. In the future, contributions will absolutely be accepted and I'll
welcome pull requests. At that point, please feel free to add yourself as an
author in the docblock of any class or method you make changes to.
